    "Imagine a continuous bioreactor (CSTR) where a cell culture (Biomass X) grows using a substrate (S) and produces a vaccine molecule (P). \n",

    "| Electricity (industrial tariff) | **€ 0.17 – € 0.19 per kWh** | varies by EU state |\n",
    "| Baseline power consumption (mixing + pumps) | **6 – 12 kW** | assume average 8 kW |\n",
    "| Additional cooling if T = 40°C | **+25 – 50%** more electricity | heat removal penalty |\n",
    "| Cooling power (chiller equivalent load) | **+4 – 8 kW** | depends on metabolism/scale |\n",
    "| Estimated hourly electricity cost (base 8 kW) | **8 kW × €0.18 ≈ €1.44/h** | if T = 20–30°C |\n",
    "| Estimated hourly electricity cost at 40°C | **(~12 kW) × €0.18 ≈ €2.16/h** | extra cooling included |\n",
    "| Stainless-steel bioreactor CAPEX (1000 L) | **€ 100,000 – € 150,000** | purchase cost |\n",
    "| Stainless-steel amortization | **€ 1.2 – € 1.8 per hour** | assuming 8,000 h/year for 10 years |\n",
