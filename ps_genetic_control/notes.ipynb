    "# Problem 1: Nullcline Analysis and Bistability\n",
    "\n",
    "The toggle switch consists of two mutually repressing genes. Here's a normalized model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta_x}{1+y^n} - x, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta_y}{1+x^n} - y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For symmetric parameters $\\beta_x = \\beta_y = \\beta$, derive the condition on $\\beta$ and $n$ for bistability to exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nullclines are $x = \\beta/(1+y^n)$ and $y = \\beta/(1+x^n)$. For what parameter values do these curves intersect three times? Express your answer as a relationship between $\\beta$ and $n$.\n",

    "# Problem 2: Modeling Inducers in a Toggle Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis of the Gardner and Collins synthetic toggle switch, we did not include a way to represent the addition of the inducer signals. Such signals typically function by decreasing a receptor's affinity for its target binding site, in other words by increasing the value of the Hill repression constant $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a plot representing the following scenario:\n",
    "* The circuit is built with parameters $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $n$ fixed to be $\\beta = 10$, $\\gamma = 1$, $n=10$.\n",
    "* The plot has sliders for $k_x$ and $k_y$, which represent the presence of inducer signal to inactivate the repressors $X$ and $Y$, respectively. (Note that this representation assumes that the inducer's action is linearly proportional to its concentration, which is typically not true but gives the right qualitative result).\n",
    "* The plot shows how the nullclines, change as you add and remove the inducer signals.\n",

    "where $\\beta/\\gamma_m$ represents the translational burst size. Given $\\beta$ = 20 proteins·mRNA⁻¹·min⁻¹ and $\\gamma_m$ = 0.33 min⁻¹:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the protein Fano factor and CV. If steady-state protein levels are ~1000 molecules/cell, what is the standard deviation? Why is protein noise super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) despite proteins being produced from many independent mRNA?\n",

    "1. For which species (mRNA or protein) will relative fluctuations (CV) be larger?\n",
    "2. During a transition from repressed to induced state, will cell-to-cell variability be higher during the transient or at steady state?\n",
