    "Computational bioengineering requires a clear conceptual map of biological systems before we can attempt to model them. Distinguishing the different biological scales and understanding the unique properties of microorganisms is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biology vs. Microbiology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biology**: studies life in all its forms, from molecular mechanisms to ecosystems.  \n",
    "- **Microbiology**: focuses on microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, viruses, unicellular eukaryotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does this matter in computational bioengineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Biology provides the general principles (e.g., DNA structure, metabolism, evolution).  \n",
    "- Microbiology provides experimental models that are computationally tractable because bacteria (like *E. coli*) are simpler, grow fast, and have well‑characterized genomes and molecular pathways.\n",

    "## Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be divided into two fundamental types: Prokaryotic cells (such as Bacteria, Archaea, etc.) and Eukaryotic cells (Animals, Plants, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, a **prokaryotic** cell is like a small studio apartment where everything happens in one room, while a **eukaryotic** cell is like a large house with many rooms, each with a special function.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | **Prokaryotic Cells (Bacteria, Archaea)** | **Eukaryotic Cells (Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protists)** |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Nucleus** | No nucleus; DNA in **nucleoid** | **True nucleus** with nuclear membrane |\n",
    "| **Size** | Small: **1–5 µm** | Larger: **10–100 µm** |\n",
    "| **Organelles** | None (no membrane-bound organelles) | Many: mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes |\n",

    "### 1. Nucleus\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prokaryotic cells:** They don’t have a nucleus. Their DNA floats freely in a part of the cell called the **nucleoid**.  \n",
    "- **Eukaryotic cells:** They have a **true nucleus**, which is a membrane-bound “control center” that stores DNA and directs all cell activities, like the brain of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prokaryotic cells:** Small, usually **1–5 micrometers (µm)**.  \n",
    "- **Eukaryotic cells:** Bigger, usually **10–100 µm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Organelles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prokaryotic cells:** Very simple, with no membrane-bound organelles. Everything happens in the same space.  \n",
    "- **Eukaryotic cells:** Complex, with many specialized compartments called **organelles**, each performing a specific function:  \n",
    "  - **Mitochondria**: produce energy for the cell  \n",
    "  - **Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**: makes proteins and fats  \n",
    "  - **Golgi apparatus**: packages and ships proteins and other molecules  \n",
    "  - **Lysosomes**: break down waste and recycle materials\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 4. Genetic Material\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prokaryotic cells:** DNA is circular and may also have **plasmids** (small extra DNA rings).  \n",
    "- **Eukaryotic cells:** DNA is linear and wrapped around proteins called **histones**, organized in a structure called **chromatin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Gene Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prokaryotic cells:** DNA is transcribed and translated **at the same time in the cytoplasm**, which allows the cell to make proteins quickly.  \n",
    "- **Eukaryotic cells:** DNA is transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm. This separation allows for more control but is slower.\n",

    "## The Central Dogma\n",
    "\n",
    "The **central dogma of molecular biology** describes how genetic information flows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**DNA → RNA → Protein**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the basic roadmap of how cells turn genetic information into functional molecules. DNA is made up of **genes**, which are sequences of nucleotides that store the instructions for building proteins. Structurally, DNA is double-stranded, while RNA is usually single-stranded and can travel from the nucleus to the ribosome.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why don’t cells synthesize proteins directly from DNA?**  \n",
    "DNA cannot leave the nucleus in eukaryotes, so RNA acts as a “temporary copy” of the gene, carrying the instructions safely to the ribosome where proteins are made.\n",
    "Even in prokaryotes, RNA is used as a temporary copy of DNA for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regulation: mRNA levels can be quickly adjusted to control protein production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple copies: Many ribosomes can translate the same mRNA simultaneously, speeding up protein synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DNA protection: Using mRNA reduces the risk of damaging the original DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coordination: Polycistronic mRNAs allow multiple genes to be expressed together efficiently (e.g., operons).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Transcription\n",
    "\n",
    "[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zyb8bpGMR0)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**DNA → mRNA (through RNA polymerase)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of transcription is to read DNA and **synthesize mRNA**, which contains the \"recipe\" (genetic instructions in the form of codons) to build one or more proteins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During transcription, there are four important actors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DNA**: made up of genes  \n",
    "- **RNA polymerase**: the key enzyme that makes an RNA copy of a gene. It does **not need primers**, but it does require a **promoter**, a DNA sequence “upstream” of a gene that signals where transcription should begin.  \n",
    "- **Sigma factors**: proteins that guide RNA polymerase to the right promoters and are highly task-specific (e.g., σ70 for housekeeping genes, σ32 during heat shock).  \n",
    "- **mRNA**: synthesized during this step. In prokaryotes, mRNA can be **polycistronic**, encoding multiple proteins from a single transcript (common in operons, e.g., lac operon).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO2ulKGQy5k)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**mRNA → Protein (through ribosomes)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of translation is to **read the mRNA “recipe” and assemble the corresponding protein**, linking amino acids in the correct order (each codon specifies one amino acid). In prokaryotes, translation can occur **while transcription is still ongoing**; this is called **coupled transcription–translation**, which allows the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During translation, there are four main elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mRNA**: carries genetic instructions from DNA in the form of codons (three-nucleotide sequences), specific for each amino acid.  \n",
    "- **Ribosomes**: the cell’s **protein factories**, which read the codons on mRNA and catalyze peptide bond formation to link amino acids in order. Ribosomes bind to the **Shine-Dalgarno sequence** on the mRNA to start translation.  \n",
    "- **tRNA (transfer RNA)**: acts like a delivery truck carrying the correct amino acid to the ribosome. Each tRNA has an **anticodon** that matches a codon on the mRNA, ensuring the correct amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.  \n",
    "- **Protein chain (polypeptide)**: synthesized by the ribosome as it links amino acids together. Polypeptides must **fold into their functional three-dimensional structure**, sometimes with the help of **chaperones**, to become usable by the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Protein Folding & Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Convert the linear polypeptide chain into a functional, active protein that can perform cellular tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Folding**: Polypeptides fold into specific 3D structures determined by the sequence of amino acids.  \n",
    "- **Chaperones**: Some proteins require helper proteins called chaperones to fold correctly and avoid misfolding.  \n",
    "- **Functional roles of proteins**:  \n",
    "  - **Enzymes**: catalyze biochemical reactions  \n",
    "  - **Structural proteins**: maintain cell shape and integrity  \n",
    "  - **Regulatory proteins**: control gene expression and signaling pathways  \n",
    "  - **Transport proteins**: move molecules across membranes  \n",
    "- Misfolded proteins can be degraded by the cell to prevent damage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the central dogma in prokaryotes ensures **rapid, efficient production of functional proteins** from DNA, with transcription, translation, and folding tightly coordinated to respond to environmental changes.\n",
