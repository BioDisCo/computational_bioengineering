    "      - Digest for 1-2 hours at appropriate temperature\n",
    "      - Critical: Dephosphorylate vector with CIP or rSAP to prevent self-ligation\n",
    "      - Purification: Sometimes gel extraction is necessary to separate the linear backbone from the remaining parts\n",
    "    - PCR Amplification of Backbone\n",

    "      - This is available under certain constraints like GC content, repetitions, and length.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, if you already have a plasmid with the wanted sequence on it, you can use PCR to extract it (see backbone).\n",
