    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the sequence of experimental steps to obtain a certain result is specified in so called protocols. \n",
    "It is central to the scientific method that protocols are shared among researchers so that experiments can be reproduced.\n",
    "Protocols can be found in Methods sections of papers, although often steps that are assumed to be known, are missing - thus making it difficult to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "In greater detail, protocols are shared by:\n",
    "- dedicated journals like [Nature methods](https://www.nature.com/nmeth/)\n",
    "- websites like [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io)\n",
    "- companies that sell consumables for protocols (for example [NEB](https://www.neb.com/en))\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice start into basic protocols and procedures like pipetting and centrifugation can be found at [www.addgene.org/protocols/](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/). We also found their videos really helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a particularly important technique in greater details: [cloning of a plasmid](sites/gibson_assembly.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick reference of protocols you may often need when engineering bacteria.\n",
