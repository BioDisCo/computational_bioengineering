    "# Homework: The Inverter\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture we constructed the \"Hello world\" plasmid. Upon induction with IPTG, it expresses a protein that colors it pink.\n",
    "This can be seen as a Buffer gate `Y = BUF(A)` with digital input `A`, digital output `Y`, and steady-state relation `Y = A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the homework, you will adapt this design to an Inverter `Z = INV(A)` with digital input `A`, digital output `Z`, and steady-state relation `Y = not(A)`.\n",
    "All of this should be done with Python code like in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1: Genetic Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify genetic components that you need to create the inverting logic. You should keep the lac promoter for the IPTG input, but add a second promoter and other required parts. Draw this design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2: Construct the linear fragment\n",
    "\n",
    "Put them all together on a single linear fragment. You may assume that you can order this from a company - in particular, there is no need to split this up into smaller fragments that need to be glued together with Gibson Assembly.\n",
    "Draw the fragment and describe your design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3: Simulate Gibson Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate Gibson Assembly of the linearized backbone (you can choose between restriction enzymes and PCR as you like).\n",
    "Draw the final construct and describe your design decisions."
